# CPN Modeller

CPN Modeller is a tool for building [colored petri nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloured_Petri_net) (CPN), a 
mathematical modelling language. The project was started for two main reasons. The first one being a good experience for
the contributors, and the second one being out of frustration with CPNTools, which is the de-facto tool for creating 
CPNs.

## Goals
The goal for CPN Modeller is to be an intuitive interface, allowing you to build your models without frustration. The
main priority is to complete the graphical aspect of modelling, however, verification and simulation are definitely 
features in consideration.
